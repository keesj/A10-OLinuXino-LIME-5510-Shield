The project brings togteher quite a few things I learned in the past including 3d drawing using openscad, design using KiCad, Kernel and driver development (Linux / Device tree), Electronics design and properly setting up a debian based system.

The initial goal of this project was to create a small device what could be used to install custom "ROM"s on Android devices using the fastboot tools.

You can find the source code schematics BOM and such on `the project git repository`_. 
The source code for this website is also stored in `git in a branch`_
