## LCD Shield project for the A10 OLinuXino LIME

Small project to create an LCD shield for the OLinuXino LIME.

This repository contains mainly the artifacts for the project. Documentation will be found or the hg-pages

The project brings togteher quite a few things I learned in the past including 3d drawing using openscad, design using KiCad, Kernel and driver development (Linux / Device tree), Electronics design
and properly setting up a debian based system.
