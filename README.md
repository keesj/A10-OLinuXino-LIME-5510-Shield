## LCD Shield project for the A10 OLinuXino LIME

Small project to create an LCD shield for the OLinuXino LIME.

This repository contains mainly the artifacts for the project. Documentation about the process of creating such a module can be found 
on (http://keesj.github.io/A10-OLinuXino-LIME-5510-Shield/)

The project brings togteher quite a few things I learned in the past including 3d drawing using openscad, design using KiCad, Kernel and driver development (Linux / Device tree), Electronics design
and properly setting up a debian based system.
